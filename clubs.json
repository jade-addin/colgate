Our <em>pose caf&eacute;s</em> provide students the prospect of practicing vocabulary and self-expression in a judgment-free, cooperative environment. The <em>pose caf&eacute;s</em>, also, take advantage of the language interns and advanced students, who interact and assist the beginning speakers. Overall, interaction between the varying levels of fluency creates bonds between students and lasting language retention. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman';\">II) To understand the connections between language and culture beyond the classroom and beyond prominent stereotypes. Aside from excellent language practice, the <em>pose caf&eacute;s</em> provide an avenue to explore and discuss current events in the francophone world, as well as expose students to new French traditions and cultures. &nbsp;As the official language in 29 countries across four continents, there is a definitive global presence of the French culture beyond the borders of France. Although Colgate University provides study abroad programs to Dijon, France and Geneva, Switzerland the French Club endeavors to widen student&rsquo;s perspectives towards the variety of cultures associated with</span><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #262626;\">la communaut&eacute; francophone</span></em><em><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman';\">.</span></em><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman';\"> Due to the lack of options in Colgate University s&rsquo; study abroad repertoire, the French club will organize cultural-linguistic excursions to underrepresented French speaking regions. By organizing explorations to underrepresented regions, students unable to participate in Colgate&rsquo;s study abroad programs benefit from the cultural immersion while becoming aware of the different cultures present in the tradition of the French language in addition to France.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman';\">III) To instill a deeper appreciation towards the tradition of Romance languages. By recognizing the importance of foreign languages in an increasingly globalized world, the French Club will actively promote the study and celebration of Romance languages. The promotion of Romance Languages will be accomplished though visits to other language departments of neighboring colleges, attending symposia, plays, and hosting Romance language banquets. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman';\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';\">Pour </span></em><em><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';\">libert&eacute;, fraternit&eacute;, et caf&eacute;!</span></em></p>","Summary":"The French club's initiatives promote the integration of the Francophone culture with regular expression of the French language and culture to a diverse campus community.

The space also serves as a political avenue to share debates, organize members and generate activism.
